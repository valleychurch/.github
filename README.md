# Valley Church
## Creating a Home to Empower a New Generation

With a call from Psalm 78, Senior Pastors Ed & Michele Carter launched Valley Church in April 2007. Our desire is to empower you to fulfil all that God has for you and called you to be. We believe that Church should be a home for everyone, no matter who they are or where they've come from. We long to empower the new generation to continually direct the future of the Church.
